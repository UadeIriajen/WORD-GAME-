# WORD-GAME-
A simple and interactive word guessing game built in Python. Players are given a list of scrambled letters and must guess the correct word.  

 🧠 How the Game Works
 
1. The game picks a word (e.g. `"python"`).  
2. The letters are scrambled (e.g. `"nhtpyo"`).  
3. You see the scrambled letters and try to guess the correct word.  
4. The game checks your guess and gives the result.
